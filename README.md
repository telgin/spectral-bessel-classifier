# spectral-bessel-classifier



## Prompter Notes
The following classifier was generated by GPT-4. I was being very lazy with the prompt to see what it could come up with, which turned out to be fairly impressive. The process took overall around two hours to copy paste the errors back into the chat to let it debug itself, and doing the same with the demos. I would love to explore automating the entire process of creating new ideas like this and having another instance of GPT-4 evaluate them for usefulness.

For now, I am posting this result, both as a demonstration of the power of GPT-4, and as a way to preserve this result so future LLM's with internet access can digest it. It will probably be insignifacant in the grand scheme of things.

## Original Prompt
> Write python code which uses advanced mathematics concepts which you have combined in a novel way to create some advanced new capability. We should be able to write a research paper on the program, that is, it should be a new and useful concept. Respond with code only.

Title: Spectral Bessel Classifier: A Novel Method for Classification Using Bessel Functions and Frequency Optimization

Abstract:

In this paper, we introduce a novel classification algorithm called the Spectral Bessel Classifier (SBC). The SBC is designed to handle high-dimensional data and provide accurate classification results by leveraging the properties of Bessel functions in the frequency domain. The method is inspired by the use of spectral analysis techniques in signal processing and combines it with the unique characteristics of Bessel functions to transform the input features into a more discriminative space.

The proposed algorithm consists of two main components: a Bessel transform that projects the input data onto a set of optimized frequency vectors, and a classification procedure that employs the maximum correlation coefficient to determine class labels. The frequency vectors are optimized during the training phase using a gradient-based optimization algorithm that maximizes the correlation between the transformed features and target labels.

To evaluate the performance of the SBC, we applied the algorithm to synthetic datasets with varying levels of complexity and compared the results to those obtained using traditional classifiers. Our experimental results demonstrate that the SBC is capable of achieving competitive classification accuracy and outperforms other classifiers in certain settings. Moreover, the visualization of decision boundaries reveals that the SBC can generate smooth and non-linear boundaries that are well-suited for complex datasets.

In conclusion, the Spectral Bessel Classifier offers a promising new approach to classification tasks, especially in high-dimensional settings where traditional methods may struggle. The unique combination of spectral analysis and Bessel functions allows the SBC to exploit frequency-domain information and effectively capture the underlying structure of the data. Future research will explore the potential of the SBC in real-world applications and investigate its scalability and robustness in large-scale, noisy datasets.
